My tea’s gone cold, I’m wonderin why i got out of bed at all.
the morning rain clouds up my window and i can’t see at all.
And even if i could it’d all be grey. with your picture on my wall.
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad 
Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not have got them
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
